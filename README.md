# Persian News Article Information Retrieval System

Implemented **Information Retrieval (IR)** system on a dataset of Persian news articles. You can find the [Test Data here](https://github.com/SahandNoey/Information-Retrieval-Course-Project/blob/master/IR_data_news_5k%202.json).

For each query, the system retrieves and prints **only the first document ID** using three distinct index types:

1. **Standard Index**: Uses **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** to search across all documents.
2. **Positional Index**: Prioritizes documents containing consecutive terms from the query. If none are found, it behaves like the Standard Index.
3. **Champion List Index**: Focuses on documents where the query term occurs at least five times, providing faster search results, though it may miss some relevant documents.

## System Highlights

### 1. Text Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline ensures that the text is prepared for efficient retrieval by performing:
- **Lemmatization**: Converts different word forms and verb tenses into their root forms.
- **Normalization**: Ensures consistency by unifying case and removing special characters.
- **Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words (tokens) for further analysis.

### 2. Inverted Index Creation
An **Inverted Index** was constructed to facilitate fast document retrieval. This index maps each word to a list of the documents (articles) in which it appears.

### 3. Positional Index Support
A **Positional Index** is also included, which tracks the position of terms in documents. This index enhances the systemâ€™s ability to process phrase queries by identifying documents where specific terms appear in sequence.

### 4. Phrase Query Handling
The system can process phrase queries, leveraging the **Positional Index** to find documents that contain the exact phrase by verifying the term positions.

### 5. Relevance Calculation
To rank documents based on their relevance to the query:
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is used to assign importance to terms within both individual documents and the overall collection.
- **Cosine Similarity** measures how closely each document matches the query.

### 6. Champion List for Efficient Search
A **Champion List** technique is employed to enhance retrieval speed. By focusing on a limited subset of highly relevant documents (those where terms occur at least five times), the system can deliver faster results, though some related documents might not be retrieved.

This version keeps all the key details but organizes and rephrases them to make the structure and flow a bit different from the original. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
